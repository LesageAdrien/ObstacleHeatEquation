# ObstacleHeatEquation
A heat equation simulation with a black cold circular obstacle. Using two Fictitious Domain Method, a saddle point one and an Augmented Lagrangian one. The temperature on the left side is 1. The temperature of the right side and of the circle and is 0. The top and bottom sides are adiabatic (Neumann conditions).
